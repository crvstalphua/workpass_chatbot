Some companies also take the chance to complain about other things such as CorpPass or foreign work pass issues, said Mr Vincent Chen, 27, an interviewer. The job involves calling up companies or households to help them, or remind them to, submit their responses to the Ministry of Manpower\'s surveys. Some companies also take the chance to complain about other things such as CorpPass or foreign work pass issues, said Mr Vincent Chen, 27, an interviewer. He helps raise such cases to their respective departments. After Covid-19 hit this year, the challenges have grown. It has been even harder to reach company staff, many of whom are working from home, Mr Chen told The Straits Times. Statistical executive Tan Chairat, 24, said interviewers contacting households have also cut down the number of ""field visits"" - house visits to people who do not answer their phones - from two or three times a week to two or three times a month. But the survey responses are crucial because that is how the department gathers labour market data such as unemployment and retrenchment numbers and how quickly people can find a new job.\n', metadata={'result_id': 'fe26744f-a208-45ad-b500-a8c204ad2b8e-f17a7ffe-60da-44dd-9791-0c096ae30ef9', 'document_id': 'https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/media-articles/2020/0924-mom-team-gathering-and-analysing-labour-market-data-busier-than-usual-amid-covid19.pdf', 'source': 'https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/media-articles/2020/0924-mom-team-gathering-and-analysing-labour-market-data-busier-than-usual-amid-covid19.pdf', 'title': '0924-mom-team-gathering-and-analysing-labour-market-data-busier-than-usual-amid-covid19', 'excerpt': '278195062;g? obOrigUrl=true https://www.straitstimes.com/ Joanna Seow Manpower Correspondent  (mailto:joseow@sph.com.sg) SINGAPORE - From being shouted at by angry respondents to having to teach a crash course in labour market terms like ""short work week"" and ""temporary layoffs"", work as a Manpower Research and Statistics Department (MRSD) survey interviewer has its fair share of challenges.

According to the law, one cannot work before a S Pass has been issued. Based on the evidence above, I instructed the worker to report the matter to MOM, hoping she could recover some of her agency fees. However, MOM’s response was a disappointing one. Under MOM’s regulations, an EA only needs to refund 50% of the agency fees if a worker has been terminated (sic). This apparently is a money making loop hole for EAs and employers. The fee for the work pass application is $60 and a medical examination costs $40. Despite such low costs, the EA collected $5,000 in agency fees. It only needed to refund half the amount based on MOM’s regulations, and stands to profit $2,500. The worker tried to inform the MOM investigator that her S Pass had not been issued and thus she should not be made to work.

See Leng's assurances that the new Overseas Networks and Expertise (One) Pass is good for Singaporeans (S'poreans will not miss out on senior roles amid schemes to draw global talent: Minister, Oct 1). The One Pass is valid for five years and is not tied to any measurable objectives such as creation of jobs for Singaporeans or annual turnover. The One Pass should be issued for a shorter period and be renewable yearly subject to meeting tangible criteria related to its stated objective of bringing in global talent who can create more opportunities for Singaporeans. Please set proper criteria, then monitor and ensure compliance. Otherwise, the One Pass will just be a five-year Employment Pass at a higher qualifying salary.

Employers will continue to be fully insured (first dollar coverage) for the medical expenses of their Work Permits and S Pass holders up to $15,000. While this ensures protection for the bulk of workers’ medical bills, there remains an average of over 1,000 employers1 per year who face bills that are larger than $15,000. With higher coverage, insurers will also co-pay 75% for amounts above $15,000, up to an annual claim limit of at least $60,000. The increased annual claim limit will cover more than 99% of Work Permit and S Pass holders’ inpatient and day surgery bills. See Annex A for some illustrations. Standardisation of allowable exclusion clauses. This provides employers and workers with greater clarity on their coverage and the types of claims they are eligible for.
