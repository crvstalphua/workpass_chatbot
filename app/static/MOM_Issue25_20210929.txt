Q: Hi Jo-An! Tell us more about yourself.
A: I am Jo-An Santiago Balberona and I'm a mother of three children. I have worked
in Singapore for 14 years. On my rest days, I take up courses to help me to perform
well in my job. I've learnt how to cook different types of cuisines, improved my skills as
a caregiver, and even enrolled myself in Theology-related courses. I am also a group
leader and a volunteer for the children ministry at my church.

Q: Having worked in Singapore for so long, how would you describe your
relationship with your employer?
I have worked with my current employer for about five years. My employer
and the family are understanding, kind and generous to me.
Once, I woke up several times in the night to attend to my employer's
baby who fell ill. My employer noticed that I was tired and spoke to me. I
explained the reason and she allowed me to take a nap after completing
my chores.
Sometimes I couldn't understand my employer's instructions. I would then
politely request her to repeat them. But if I still did not understand, I would
not hesitate to clarify further. I would not pretend to understand because I
may end up making more mistakes.
Q: Do you have any tips to share with other MDWs?
A: Communication is the key to maintaining a good relationship with your employer.
1
Pay attention and listen carefully to your employer's instructions. Write them
down so that you can remember them easily.
2
Check in and discuss with your employer on how he/she feels about your work
performance.
3
Be honest and always tell the truth.
4
Be humble and respectful towards your employer.

Seek help from your neighbours,
fellow MDWs or any member of the
public.
Write a simple note including your
name, work permit number and
home address, and pass it to your
neighbour or any member of
the public.
Don't hesitate or be afraid to seek help!
Enhancements to
Six-Monthly Medical Examination (6ME) for MDWs
From 29 August 2021, MOM has made several changes to the 6ME requirements for
all MDWs.
Recording of a MDW's weight and height
Employer or employer's representative is not allowed in the examination room.
During the examination, the doctor will also check for signs of suspicious and unexplained injury.
T
You are encouraged to dress in attire that can facilitate these checks, e.g., a short-sleeved t-shirt
and bermudas.
MDWs are not required to undress for a comprehensive physical examination unless the doctor
suspects there are injuries on areas that are covered by the clothing. In such cases, the MDW
may be asked to remove an article of clothing for examination.

Illegal Deployment/
NO
Employment of MDWs
is a Serious Offence
An MDW's employer baked and sold confectionaries at home.
PENALTY
She asked her two MDWs to assist her with the baking.
$
By asking her two MDWs to assist her with her home business,
the employer was convicted and fined $12,000.
If you are requested by your employer to work for his/her business, you should reply that
it is illegal to do SO. If your employer insists, you should call MOM MDW Helpline
(1800-339 5505) to report the case.
Do not worry that your employment will be affected if you make a report against your
employer. If your claim is valid, MOM will put you in a safe home and allow you to find a
new employer.
PENALTY
$
A word of
MOM takes every allegation of illegal deployment
seriously. Do not make false allegations against
caution:
your employer. It is an offence to give false
information to MOM. You will be charged in court
and fined up to $15,000 and/or jailed for up to
12 months.
